# alburnum-maas-client

Python client API library specially adapted to work with
MAAS (https://maas.ubuntu.com/).

This was created by a core MAAS developer (Gavin Panella) so
ought to work just about. It was written in his own time, and
it's licensed under the GNU Affero GPLv3 too, the same as MAAS
itself.
