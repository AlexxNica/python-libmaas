alburnum-maas-client
====================

Python client API library made especially for
`MAAS <https://maas.ubuntu.com/>`__.

This was created by a core MAAS developer (Gavin Panella) so ought to
just about work. It was written in his own time, and it's licensed under
the GNU Affero GPLv3 too, the same as MAAS itself.

Dependencies
------------

You'll need the ``maascli`` package. It's not on PyPI unfortunately. On
Ubuntu, install the ``maas-cli`` system package:

::

    $ sudo apt-get install maas-cli

All the other dependencies are declared already in ``setup.py``.

Example code
------------

First you need to create a *profile* with the ``maas`` command-line
tool. There is `documentation for
that <https://maas.ubuntu.com/docs1.8/maascli.html#logging-in>`__ on the
MAAS website.

Here's a snippet that creates a tag and associates it with every node in
the MAAS:

.. code:: python

    import httplib
    from pprint import pprint

    from alburnum.maas.client import (
        CallError,
        SessionAPI,
    )

    # Load a MAAS CLI profile. The name below (here "madagascar") should be the
    # name of a profile created when using `maas login` at the command-line.
    papi = SessionAPI.fromProfileName("madagascar")

    # Create a tag if it doesn't exist.
    tag_name = "foo"
    try:
        tag = papi.Tag.read(name=tag_name)
    except CallError as error:
        if error.status == httplib.NOT_FOUND:
            tag = papi.Tags.new(
                name=tag_name, comment="%s's Stuff" % tag_name.capitalize())
        else:
            raise

    # List all the MAAS's tags.
    print(" Tags.list() ".center(50, "="))
    pprint(papi.Tags.list())

    # Associate the tag with all nodes.
    print(" Tag.update_nodes() ".center(50, "="))
    pprint(papi.Tag.update_nodes(
        name=tag["name"], add=[
            node["system_id"] for node in papi.Nodes.list()
        ]))
